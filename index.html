        <h2>Sandalwood is everywhere!</h2>
        <p>
          Sandalwood oil is extracted from the woods. Sandalwood is often cited
          as one of the most expensive woods in the world. Both the wood and the
          oil produce a distinctive fragrance that has been highly valued for
          centuries. Consequently, some species of these slow-growing trees have
          suffered over-harvesting in the past.
